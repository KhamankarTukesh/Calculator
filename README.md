## 📜 How It Works

1. User clicks number buttons to enter values
2. Selects an operator (`+  −  ×  ÷`)
3. Enters the second number
4. Presses **=** to calculate the result
5. Uses:

   * **←** to remove last character
   * **C** to clear the entire input

The calculator manages state internally to prevent invalid operations.

## ⚠️ Edge Cases Handled

* Prevents multiple operators at once
* Handles division by zero safely
* Resets state correctly after calculation
* Input field is **read-only** (button-only input)

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Strong understanding of **JavaScript events**
* Managing calculator state & logic
* Working with strings and numbers
* Building responsive UI using CSS Grid & Flexbox
* Deploying projects on **Vercel**
